This document explains how to use R scripting language for downloading MODIS data and analyzing it within R. The results of the analysis of MODIS data within R are illustrated. For this time series analysis demonstration it is not required to know R details, we only use R for some practical demonstration of its great potential. In this exercise we will automatically download MODIS data for specific locations around the world. 

# Introduction to MODIS data and online analysis

The MODIS satellite data that we will download for this time series analysis exercise is available from [MODIS Subsetting Website](https://modis.ornl.gov/sites/). MODIS data is made available for specific locations. 

More specifically, we will look at the MODIS product called MOD13Q1 which are *global 16-day images at a spatial resolution of 250 m*. Each image contains several bands; i.e. blue, red, and near-infrared reflectances, centered at 469-nanometers, 645-nanometers, and 858-nanometers, respectively, are used to determine the MODIS vegetation indices.

The MODIS Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) complements NOAA's Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) NDVI products and provides continuity for time series historical applications. MODIS also includes a new Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) that minimizes canopy background variations and maintains sensitivity over dense vegetation conditions. The EVI also uses the blue band to remove residual atmosphere contamination caused by smoke and sub-pixel thin clouds. The MODIS NDVI and EVI products are computed from atmospherically corrected surface reflectances that have been masked for water, clouds, heavy aerosols, and cloud shadows.

Vegetation indices are used for global monitoring of vegetation conditions and are used in products displaying land cover and land cover changes. 
We will work with the MODIS NDVI band within the MOD13Q1 product. More information about this MODIS data set can be found via the [MODIS product table](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/products/mod13q1v006/).


Now go to the [MODIS Land Products](https://modis.ornl.gov/sites/):

  * Search for 'Netherlands' and select the 'Gelderland Loobos' Site.
  * Select the MODIS 13Q1 product by clicking on it.There is no immediate need to create an account unless you want to manually download the MODIS data via this website. In the below explanation, we will download MODIS NDVI data via an R script.
  * Under 'Download data' tab and table, via the website, you can see the **Pixel Numbering Scheme** where the blue pixel (i.e. 545) is the "site pixel" (i.e. the middle of the spatial subset).

```{block, type="alert alert-success"}
> **Question 1**: What are the three main land cover types close to the center of the site? (see additional information on the bottom of the [MODIS13Q1 page](https://modis.ornl.gov/cgi-bin/sites/site/?id=nl_gelderland_loobos&product=MOD13Q1)). Which land cover type is correct and which one not?
```

# Automated MODIS NDVI download and analysis via R

We will download the MODIS data for the Loobos Site via R and process the data for one location to detect changes within the time series.

If it is the first time that you work with R or Rstudio, you can follow the following tutorial on getting started with [R and Rstudio](https://geoscripting-wur.github.io/Scripting4GeoIntro/).


## Getting started: install packages and load the necessary functions for MODIS data analysis

Now we are ready to get started with the MODIS time series analysis exercise in R! 

First, choose your working directory (i.e. a folder on your hard drive) to which the MODIS data will be downloaded and where you will save your R script.
```{block type="alert alert-info"}
**Protip**: Do not hard code `setwd()` in your R script as the path might be different on another computer, and therefore your script will not be fully reproducible by others.
```

In RStudio you can set your working directory this way, if you have saved your R script to your working directory:
![](figs/setwd_rstudiotip.png)

Check your working directory by

```{r, eval = FALSE}
getwd() # check if your working directory is correctly set
```


The necessary add-on packages need to be installed within R before loading the package 
using the `library()` function. 
Below we define a helper function that installs the R package if it is not installed yet, and then also loads it using the `library` function:

```{r, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
# pkgTest is a helper function to load packages and install packages only when they are not installed yet.
pkgTest <- function(x)
{
  if (x %in% rownames(installed.packages()) == FALSE) {
    install.packages(x, dependencies= TRUE)
  }
  library(x, character.only = TRUE)
}
neededPackages <- c("strucchange","zoo", "bfast", "raster", "leaflet", "MODISTools")
for (package in neededPackages){pkgTest(package)}
```


Loading extra function to create a time series object in R via `timeser` function:
(via `mt_to_raster` a raster stack from the MODIS subset (downloaded with the `mt_subset` function))

```{r, message = FALSE}
timeser <- function(index, dt) {
    z <- zoo(index, dt)
    yr <- as.numeric(format(time(z), "%Y"))
    jul <- as.numeric(format(time(z), "%j"))
    delta <- min(unlist(tapply(jul, yr, diff))) # 16
    zz <- aggregate(z, yr + (jul - 1) / delta / 23)
    (tso <- as.ts(zz))
    return(tso)
  }
```

## Downloading MODIS data using the MODISTools package

First we download the MODIS data via the `mt_subset` function and immediately create raster brick from it with the `mt_to_raster` function:

```{r, eval=TRUE, results="hide"}
VI <- mt_subset(product = "MOD13Q1",
                site_id = "nl_gelderland_loobos",
                band = "250m_16_days_NDVI",
                start = "2000-01-01",
                km_lr = 2,
                km_ab = 2,
                site_name = "testsite",
                internal = TRUE,
                progress = FALSE)

QA <- mt_subset(product = "MOD13Q1",
                site_id = "nl_gelderland_loobos",
                band = "250m_16_days_pixel_reliability",
                start = "2000-01-01",
                km_lr = 2,
                km_ab = 2,
                site_name = "testsite",
                internal = TRUE,
                progress = FALSE)
```

```{r, message=FALSE, include=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
load("DataLooBos_QA_VI_backup_20002019.RData")
```

## creating a raster brick and cleaning the MODIS data using the reliability layer

More information about the pixel reliability can be found here (see table 4):
https://vip.arizona.edu/documents/MODIS/MODIS_VI_UsersGuide_June_2015_C6.pdf

```{r}
# convert df to raster
VI_r <- mt_to_raster(df = VI)
QA_r <- mt_to_raster(df = QA)

## clean the data
# create mask on pixel reliability flag set all values <0 or >1 NA
m <- QA_r
m[(QA_r < 0 | QA_r > 1)] <- NA # obtain good data

# mask all values from VI raster NA
VI_m <- mask(VI_r, m,maskvalue=NA, updatevalue=NA)

# plot the first image
plot(m,1) # plot mask
plot(VI_m,1) # plot cleaned NDVI raster
```

You can (optional!) extract data from the cleaned VI raster brick via the `click` function:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# extract data from the cleaned raster for selected pixels
click(VI_m, id=TRUE, xy=TRUE, cell=TRUE, n= 1)
```

```{block type="alert alert-info"}
**Protip**: Creating a nice map with the leaflet package in R
```


```{r, warning=FALSE, results='asis', eval=FALSE}
library(leaflet)
r <- raster(VI_m,1)
pal <- colorNumeric(c("#ffffff", "#4dff88", "#004d1a"), values(r),
  na.color = "transparent")

m <- leaflet() %>% addTiles() %>%
  addRasterImage(r, colors = pal, opacity = 0.8) %>%
  addLegend(pal = pal, values = values(r),
    title = "NDVI")
m
```

## Apply BFASTmonitor

Below we extract the data from the raster as a vector and create a time series using the `timeser` function:
```{r}
## check VI data at a certain pixel e.g. 1 row, complete left hand site:
## the dimensions of the raster are: 33x33

px <- 33 # pixel number so adjust this number to select the center pixel
tspx <- timeser(as.vector(VI_m[px]),as.Date(names(VI_m), "X%Y.%m.%d")) # convert pixel 1 to a time series
plot(tspx, main = 'NDVI') # NDVI time series cleaned using the "reliability information"
```

Now we apply the `bfastmonitor` function using a `trend + harmon` model with `order 3` for the harmonics (i.e. seasonality modelling):
```{r}
bfm1 <- bfastmonitor(tspx, response ~ trend + harmon, order = 3, start = c(2018,1))
plot(bfm1)
```

Let's run it on all pixels now:

```{r}
dates <- as.Date(names(VI_m), "X%Y.%m.%d")

bfmRaster = function(pixels)
{
    tspx <- timeser(pixels, dates)
    return(bfastmonitor(tspx, response ~ trend + harmon, order = 3, start = c(2018,1))$breakpoint)
}

bfmR <- calc(VI_m, bfmRaster)
plot(bfmR, main="Date of detected break in time series")
```

```{r, include=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
bfmS = bfmSpatial(VI_m, dates=as.Date(names(VI_m), "X%Y.%m.%d"), formula=response ~ trend + harmon, order = 3, start = c(2018,1))
plot(bfmS[[1]]) # Break date
plot(bfmS[[2]]) # Break magnitude
```

## Critical questions for the BFAST AEO exercise:

```{block, type="alert alert-success"}
> **Question 2**: Now check if you detect a break in the center pixel (see pixel numbering scheme)? What happens if you change the harmonic 'order' from 3 to 1? See `?bfastmonitor`. Can you explain this in two sentences ?
```


```{block, type="alert alert-success"}
> **Question 3**:  What happens if you use a different *formula* in `bfastmonitor`? For example, `response ∼ trend`. Explain what happens and also in which sense is 2018 an abnormal year? 
```


```{block, type="alert alert-success"}
> **Question 4**:  Now try to detect a change in 2018 for another site in the world available via the [https://modis.ornl.gov/sites/](https://modis.ornl.gov/sites/) website. In your answer, mention (a) site, (b) bfastmonitor settings, (c) landcover type of that pixel and the pixel number (d) add the plot of the time series. (e) Then explain why you detect a change or what there is no change detected (max 3 sentences). (f) how could the change detection be optimised?
```
